1) Building:
	Browse to the required source directory and do: make -f Makefile.proxy all

2) Using the proxy server:
	 Build the sources on both client and server machine as mentioned in step1.
	 On server machine do:
		sudo ./proxy_server
         	Say the server is running on address: 143.215.204.191
	Server has following behavior:
		When cache is enabled (default):
			Servers needs single time initialization for which it expects an initial initialization string of the form:
				When cache size is number of urls: init,<UserString>,1-5
					Where numbers 1-5 represent the replacement policy.
					1:LRU,2:LFU,3:FIFO,4:RAND,5:MAXS
					Ex: ./proxy_client 143.215.204.191 init,Test1,1
						The above RPC call initializes the server for LRU replacement policy.
				When cache size is total memory: init,userString,MaxCacheSizeInBytes,1-5
					where MaxCacheSizeInBytes is the Maximum cache size in bytes and the rest all fields have same meaning as above
					Ex: ./proxy_client 143.215.204.191 init,Test2,4096,2
						The above RPC call initializes the server for LFU replacement policy with 4KB cache size.
		
			Changing the cache size:
				When cache size is number of urls:
					edit: proxy_data.h 
					change : MAXSIZE_CACHE to the required value
					(rebuild the sources for this to be in effect)
				When cache size is total memory:
					Use the appropriate size during initialization.
					This also requires maximum urls to be set which can be set by editing MAXSIZE_CACHE in proxy_data.h
	
			After initialization: you can send urls to be fetched.
				Ex:./proxy_client 143.215.204.191 http://www.google.com
			When done send "exit" command to the server which results in server flushing the logs and getting terminated itself.
				Ex: ./proxy_client 143.215.204.191 exit
	
		Disabling the cache:
			You can disable the cache by uncommenting the line : #define NOCACHE in proxy_server.c.

		When cache is disabled:
			you can just issue the url request.
			Ex: ./proxy_client 143.215.204.191 http://www.google.com

			Note: when cache is disabled, server needs to be terminated manually.


Note: for any changes you make to the source files, you need to rebuild for the new changes to be in the binaries.
